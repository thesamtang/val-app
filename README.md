# Val Yum

Tired of Val's often less-than-satisfactory offerings, we decided to create an app to showcase the finest examples of Amherst dining -- as well as the worst. Val Yum allows users to view the current day's meals and how popular they are among the student body, as well as contribute with their own ratings.
